## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
  # *****
  # testing parameters
  # 100, 1.8 = Tatooine
  # 200, 1.7 = Hoth
  n0 <- 200
  r0 <- 1.7

  ## Construct the reproductive number
  ## The first period: first week high reproductive number R between [1.8,2]
  ## The second period: decrease with lockdown/policy measure: quadratic function (for three weeks)
  ## The third period: plateau during the lockdown between [0.55, 0.65] (for two weeks)
  ## The fourth period: slowly increasing again until reach at 1.1 (for 5 weeks)
  ## The fifth period: steady at 1.1 (for 6 week)
  r1 <- runif(7, 1.8, 2)
  r2 <- 0.6 + 0.003 * (28 - (8:28))^2
  r3 <- runif(14, 0.55, 0.65)
  r4 <- 0.6 + (43:77 - 42) * 0.015
  r5 <- rep(1.1, 42)
  rt <- c(r1, r2, r3, r4, r5)
  plot(rt)

  r <- 3
  m <- 9
  maxdelay <- 20
  ld <- 200

  ### now reset rt
  rt <- rep(rt, length.out = ld)
  min(rt)
  plot(rt)
  rt <- c(rt, rep(1.1, 1000)) # add a ton extra
  length(rt)
  # *****

  # ----------
  # one draw from poisson given by lambda = initial cases * initial reproductive number
  # this gives the first timestep of infectees from the initial cases (?)
  n1 <- rpois(1, n0 * r0)
  # hist(rpois(1000, n0 * r0))
  # n1

  # LiT: Date of infection
  # Generation interval distribution draw for n1 infectees
  # generation interval is the time between infection and transmission
  # shape = 4.29 and rate = 1.18 are based on COVID-19 literature
  # > ceiling() rounds up to integer values for days
  # NOTE: this will be replaced by "serial interval" data later (?)
  inf1 <- rgamma(n1, shape = 4.29, rate = 1.18)
  i1 <- ceiling(inf1)
  # hist(i1)
  # length(i1)

  # LiT: Date of onset sympotom
  # Incubation period: period between exposure and appearance of symptoms
  # lognormal distribution with mean of 1.621 and sd of 0.418, based on COVID-19 literature
  # > ceiling() rounds up to integer values for days
  inc1 <- exp(rnorm(n1, 1.621, 0.418))
  o1 <- i1 + ceiling(inc1)
  # hist(o1)
  # length(o1)

  # LiT: Date of report
  # negative binomial distribution for the reporting delay between
  # testing positive and reporting to public health agencies
  # with size parameter = r and mean(mu) = m and
  # with an upper bound of l (aka `maxdelay`), the max reporting delay
  # there are n = maxdelay + 1 of these values
  p <- dnbinom(0:maxdelay, size = r, mu = m)
  d1 <- o1 + sample(0:maxdelay, size = n1, prob = p, replace = TRUE)
  # hist(d1)
  # length(d1)

  # create a combined dataset
  gen_i <- 1
  dat_tbl <- table(d1)
  i1_tbl <- table(i1)
  o1_tbl <- table(o1)

  comb_tbl <- function(t1, t2) {
    df1 <- as.data.frame(t1, stringsAsFactors = F)
    colnames(df1)[1] <- "d1"
    df2 <- as.data.frame(t2, stringsAsFactors = F)
    colnames(df2)[1] <- "d1"
    df3 <- rbind(df1, df2)
    df3 %>%
      group_by(d1) %>%
      summarize(.groups = "keep", Freq = sum(Freq))
  }

  # ----------
  # while there are any initial infection dates lower than the modeling window
  # end, simulate the next generation
  # while (gen_i < 2) {
  while (any(i1 <= ld)) {
    ## new generation
    gen_i <- gen_i + 1
    timestamp(suffix = paste(">", gen_i))

    ## Infection dates of previous generation
    date <- as.numeric(names(table(i1)))

    ## Number of cases on each date
    no <- as.numeric(table(i1))

    ## get the next iteration of r(t)
    mu <- no * rt[date]

    ## simulate the next generation of infectees
    n1 <- sapply(mu, function(mx) rpois(1, mx))

    ## and their generation interval
    inf1 <- rgamma(sum(n1), shape = 4.29, rate = 1.18)

    # include the start dates before the generation time
    i1 <- rep(date, times = n1) + ceiling(inf1)

    inc1 <- exp(rnorm(sum(n1), 1.621, 0.418))
    o1 <- i1 + ceiling(inc1)

    ## Date of report
    d1 <- o1 + sample(0:maxdelay, size = sum(n1), prob = p, replace = TRUE)

    ### SUMMARIZE
    dat_tbl <- comb_tbl(table(d1), dat_tbl)
    i1_tbl <- comb_tbl(table(i1), i1_tbl)
    o1_tbl <- comb_tbl(table(o1), o1_tbl)
  }

  dat_tbl %>%
    mutate(d1_int = type.convert(d1, as.is = T)) %>%
    ggplot(.) +
    geom_line(aes(x = d1_int, y = Freq)) +
    geom_line(aes(x = d1_int, y = Freq),
      data = o1_tbl %>%
        mutate(d1_int = type.convert(d1, as.is = T)),
      color = "red"
    ) +
    geom_line(aes(x = d1_int, y = Freq),
      data = i1_tbl %>%
        mutate(d1_int = type.convert(d1, as.is = T)),
      color = "blue"
    )
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
